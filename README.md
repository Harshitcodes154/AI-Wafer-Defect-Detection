# 🚀 AI-Based Wafer Defect Detection System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Semiconductor wafer defects reduce manufacturing yield and increase production cost. Manual inspection is slow and error-prone.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project develops an AI-powered wafer defect detection system using Deep Learning and Explainable AI.

The system not only classifies defects but also visually explains defect regions and provides decision support analytics.
